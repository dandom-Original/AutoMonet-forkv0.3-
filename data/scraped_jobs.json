    "description": "<img src=\"https://we-work-remotely.imgix.net/logos/0016/1151/logo.gif?ixlib=rails-4.0.0&amp;w=50&amp;h=50&amp;dpr=2&amp;fit=fill&amp;auto=compress\" />\n\n<p>\n  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Dublin\n    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketsolve.com\">https://ticketsolve.com</a>\n</p>\n\n<div># Introduction<br /><br />We are a SaaS ticketing platform that is very excited about the future. Coming out of the pandemic, we completed an exciting evolution of our platform. This involved moving from a traditional RoR architecture to a modern \"single page application\" (SPA), exposing our application as a set of APIs consumed by Ember to provide a rich interactive experience.<br /><br />Completing this work has allowed us to focus on new feature development. We have already seen the benefits of the new platform in terms of productivity and speed of rolling out new features.<br /><br />We want to expand our backend team with new people to cover Ruby and Ruby on Rails server development to accelerate this potential and deliver an ambitious product roadmap. In terms of experience, we are looking for experienced developers who are comfortable working with a large codebase and a complex domain.<br /><br />The work will be a mixture of new feature development exposed as APIs for the front-end development team and infrastructure-focused improvements on our backend.<br /><br />The feature areas we focus on are significant enhancements to our CRM functionality, improvements to our public API and investment in Business Intelligence and Analytics.\u00a0<br /><br />This year, a specific focus will be on building out our data and analytic capabilities using a combination of Snowflake at the data layer and Sigma for visualisation. This work will then provide a platform for integrating AI capabilities into our platform.<br /><br /># Skills &amp; Requirements<br /><br />- 4+ years experience developing web applications<br /><br />- Experience with programming Ruby/Rails required with the role focused on server development<br /><br />- Understanding of front-end technologies: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JS frameworks like React/Ember are welcomed but not required<br /><br />- Experience with Chef and Terraform a bonus<br /><br />- Strong programming skills with a focus on clean design, well-refactored code and automated testing<br /><br />- Experience with Business Intelligence and Analytics is also welcomed but\u00a0 not required<br /><br />- Comfortable working as part of a fully remote dev team.<br /><br /># Technologies we use<br /><br />- Ruby on Rails is our primary server framework evolving towards pure API server<br /><br />- EmberJs is our primary front-end development framework<br /><br />- JSONAPI::Resources, http://jsonapi-resources.com/, is how we are building our APIs<br /><br />- MySQL / Redis are our primary storage engines<br /><br />- Snowflake / Sigma are our chosen data, analytics and AI-enabling technologies<br /><br />- All our servers are Ubuntu based managed through CHEF<br /><br />- Deployed on AWS using Terraform for managing infrastructure<br /><br />- GitHub for source code management and process support<br /><br />- GitHub actions for continuous integration<br /><br /># How we work<br /><br />We run a lightweight process that focuses on feature-based weekly delivery. Our coordination and communication are mostly through daily 'catch-up meetings' and appropriate tools such as Linear for backlog management, Slack for communication and Git(GitHub) for source control and feature deployment through PRs and Milestones.<br /><br />From a coding perspective, we strongly emphasise clean, minimal, well-refactored code backed up by a robust suite of automated tests. In addition, we use peer review for all design and development work.<br /><br />In general, we strive for an approach that empowers and trusts individuals to 'do the right thing'; as a team, we try to keep each other true to this.<br /><br /># 100% Remote working<br /><br />Our development team works remotely with members in Austria, Germany, Portugal, Sweden, South Africa, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Our wider organisation has people based in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Dublin is our headquarters and main office - with the core Support and Sales and Marketing teams.<br /><br />Remote working has been part of our company's DNA since our founding. It offers many advantages to both Ticketsolve and its employees. This culture means you should be comfortable working as part of a fully remote team.<br /><br />Important to note that time zones are a consideration for us with remote working. Our experience is that European, some Asian and East Latin American time zones are preferable, allowing for collaboration at reasonable times.<br /><br /># Recruitment process<br /><br />We are initially looking for resumes and portfolio examples of your work, e.g., GitHub repositories, blog articles, etc. If you do not have anything suitable, don't worry. As part of the process, we will introduce some coding tasks, e.g., code reviews, whiteboard design sessions, and pair programming.<br /><br />From there, we filter down and do a series of remote interviews. We start with an introduction call to explain the project and answer questions. From there, we will have a mixture of technical and culture-fit calls.\u00a0<br />We prefer that candidates talk to as much of the team as possible so that we, the team and the candidate, can make the best decision possible. We will also look at facilitating face-to-face meetings if appropriate and makes sense.<br /><br />After this stage, we will be in a position to make a formal offer.<br /><br />Please submit resumes to **jobs@ticketsolve.com** with the subject **\"Job Application\"**. Please note that we will not respond to all applications due to the volume of applications; instead, we will make contact when there is a potential fit.</div>\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> <a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/ticketsolve-senior-backend-ruby-on-rails-developer\">https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/ticketsolve-senior-backend-ruby-on-rails-developer</a></p>",
